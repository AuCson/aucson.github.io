## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="self.jpg">

This is the academic homepage of Xisen Jin, a senior (4th) year undergraduate student in Fudan University, China, majored in Computer Science.

The photo is taken in Turin, Italy, while attending CIKM'18, where I gave an oral presentation on our work.

## Research Interest

My research interests mainly lie on **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. I am especially interested in semi-superivsed learning on large-scale data as well as interpretable knowledge reasoning. My past research also covers task-oriented and corpus-based dialogue systems.

I am currently working with Prof. Xiangyang Xue on post-hoc explanation of NLP models.
