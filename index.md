## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="self.jpg">

Hi, I'm Xisen Jin. I am a senior (4th) year undergraduate student in Fudan University, China, majored in Computer Science and Technology. 

The photo is taken in Turin, Italy, while attending CIKM'18 where I gave an oral presentation.

## Research Interest

My research interests mainly lie on **Natural Language Processing**. Specifically, I am interested in two complementary fields: learning explicit and structured knowledge out of data, and learning hidden but powerful representation of data.  
> I am on the way of these explorations and have some publications on these areas. [Publications](#publications)

Besides, I am interested in **Machine Learning**. I will be completing my graduate thesis with Prof. Xiangyang Xue, on interpretability of neural networks.

## Publications

1. **Xisen Jin**, Wenqiang Lei, Zhaochun Ren, Hongshen Chen, Shangsong Liang, Yihong Eric Zhao and Dawei Yin, Explicit State Tracking with Semi-Supervision for Neural Dialogue Generation, CIKM 2018, Full paper. [[code]](https://github.com/AuCson/SEDST) [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.10596.pdf)

    - The research is a step towards unsupervised state tracking and interpretable dialogue generation.
    - Our model utilize unlabeled data for dialogue state tracking.
    - The research takes basis on probablistic analysis of response generation process. It proposes a novel copyflow network and posterior regularization for training.
    
2. Wenqiang Lei, **Xisen Jin**, Min-Yen Kan, Zhaochun Ren, Xiangnan He and Dawei Yin, Sequicity: Simplifying Task-oriented Dialogue Systems with Single Sequence-to-Sequence Architectures, ACL 2018, Full paper. [[code]](https://github.com/WING-NUS/sequicity) [[paper]](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1133)

    - The research proposes an extendable and fully end-to-end dialogue model, while still keeping modular structures.
    - Our model has good out-of-vocabulary capability.
    - Our model incorporates reinforcement learning to generate more informative responses.
