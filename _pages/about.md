This is the academic homepage of Xisen Jin. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at Uninversity of Southern California, advised by [Xiang Ren](http://ink-ron.usc.edu/xiangren/).

The photo is taken in Turin, Italy, while attending CIKM'18, where I gave an oral presentation about our work "Explicit State Tracking with Semi-Supervision for Neural Dialogue Generation".

## Research Interest

My research area is **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. I am especially interested in dialogue systems, interpretable model architectures and interpretation techniques for neural networks. I am seeking ways to improve language learning ability of models.
