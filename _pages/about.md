I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at Uninversity of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Xiang Ren](http://ink-ron.usc.edu/xiangren/).

*I am actively seeking internship opportunities in 2020 summer*.

*I am also actively seeking collegues near LA to travel together to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia for ICLR :D*

## Research Interest

Generally, my research interest lies in **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. I have been working on interpretation techniques of neural network predictions and dialogue systems.

I am always interested in **understanding** the capability of machine learning models in handling **complicated semantics in language**, and **enhancing the capability in that way indicated**. Some small steps have been made towards this goal: 

- Recently, we proposed an [interpretation technique](#iclr20towards) to extract semantic compositions captured by powerful neural sequence models.

- Before that, I studied [interpretable semi-/un-supervised dialogue state tracking](#cikm18explicit) to better understand multi-turn response generation and also improved state tracking performance in the low-resource setting.

My future study includes understanding language learning process in more realistic scenarios, where multi-modality and functionality of language naturally exist in the enviornment with some practical constraints.
