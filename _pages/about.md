I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at Uninversity of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Xiang Ren](http://ink-ron.usc.edu/xiangren/).

Generally, my research interest lies in **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. I have been working on continual learning and interpretation techniques of neural network predictions. Prior to these, I studied dialogue systems.

I am always interested in **understanding** the capability of machine learning models in handling **complicated semantics in language**, and **enhancing the capability in the way indicated**. 

## News

- Jul. 2020: Two papers accepted at Lifelong Learning workshop@ICML 2020 and Continual Learning workshop@ICML 2020. We studied a task-free continual learning algorithm, and proposed a task setup for visually grounded continual compostional phrase learning.

- Apr. 2020: Our paper about reducing unintended bias in hate speech classifiers by regularizing post-hoc explanations was accepted at ACL 2020. 

- Dec. 2019: Our paper discussing explanation algorithms for compositional semantics captured in neural sequence models got spotlighted at ICLR 2020.
